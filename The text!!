Sup.

I’m Aaroneljugon1, also known as AaronEJ1YT, Aarone, Aarona, springljugon1, sprengtrep, swagtrap, Joe, Casaardiendo, Pookie, pretty boi!, Ice Cream Manager, Aarón el Dormilón, Sans (bcs of my surname smh), Sans-Culottes... etc etc. And this is some text dump about me.

I’m a young developer that likes everything related to both software, and hardware.
I got many personalities, and depends on you which one am I gonna use to talk with you.
We got:
Real funny comedian!1 🔥🔥(black, green and more kinds of humor)
Serious dude 👔(perfect for internet arguments, ngl. Its real good seeing someone freaking out while you keep that 🍷 style)
Nerd 🤓 (When you ask for me for any kind of help that’s code-related)
Formal 🍷(When I ask you for some help of any kind, and I never talked to you before)
Horny (Currently vaulted until next patch. Includes the “smooth talker” trait. Early access granted to a couple persons *looking at you, Kat*)
The comebacker (even better for internet arguments, but with dudes that you wanna troll more than proving them wrong.)
Silly (I look like Im high on weed or smtng.. Its obvious when Im like this. I tend to do stuff I would never do, usually ending up causing trouble or being cringe-)

My typing changes depending on my mood. If I use punctuation, etc, capital letters, or that kind of things, then Im on a good mood :)
If I type in lowercase and dont care about grammar, I probably tried to kill myself 10 minutes ago, or Im simply DEADASS serious :(

My friends describe me as an alpha sigma gigachad omegalord king B) (Im not autistic.)

Currently in a (great) relationship, even tho I prob wont update this whenever that changes. (If it ever does~ :3)

ROBLOX pays me some ROBUX thanks to the games I made, but people often hire me. Thats how I got so many ROBUX. 

Before we start, no DONT call me a furry. Never. In your life. Youre playing with fire. Ill block you, and I mean it. Do not fucking care who are you.

I like RPs. Specially Military, Medieval and Post-Apocalyptic RP.

I love writing changelogs lol.

I might be really forgiving, or you will never forget my name. Depends on what you've done to me.

Im based.

I got some experience in (un)ethical hacking.

I'm hooked up to some random World War I strategy game (Supremacy 1914) and I genuinely don't know what take more of my sleep hours. If this game, or Kat ;-;

My Discord is Aaroneljugon1, rblx is AaronEJ1YT (Note that Aaroneljugon1 was my first acc but nows inactive. Made first in 2016.)

I like to randomly gift robux :)

I'm becoming a jealous person-...

Do me a favor and, if someone seems sad, or like they could use some help, sit there and listen, just like I always do.

I often get involved into dark and fucked up stuff.

I cant fucking fix my steam account so ignore the scam messages coming from it-

Im quite good at catching references. Even if they well hidden.

I randomly get inspired and drop a huge chunk of text, or start writing philosophical shit-

Fallout 4 my fav game.

I made 10 games in total.

LONG LIVE TSSG!! (I miss USSF)

I love optimizations. I made a 15 year old laptop run roblox at 30-40 fps (GT 320M, first gen core i3, in Evade) 

Im more of a dogs guy, but I love cats, too!

Fav song is Ghost+++++++++++ VIP Halloween (Camellia>>>)

PS>Nintendo>Xbox.

31/1/2024 1k kills in UTPRA <3

I modded a PS4 Pro to to the point where it got a 32% faster.

I absolutely love anything related to PCs. Both hardware and software stuff.

I love every kind of music but reggae.

I can speak 3 languages: Spanish, English and kind of Valencià.

Oh, and, I love head. Felt like putting this in here for some reason :D

I’m not English, I’m Spanish, but I really love English, and also owe a lot to it, since, without it, I wouldn’t had ever met some of my closest friends. (Sorry for any bad grammar..)

Talking about that, let’s start from there.

Friends:
These are some of my best friends. Both online and in real life.:

Darkened: Also goes by Ef. I have no words to express how much I owe to this dude, and why he’s basically a core piece of my life. (I love you dude, no homo)

Reggy: (among many names) is a girl I met on a random phone game, Simple Sandbox 2 (remember this name) in 2020. We exchanged phone numbers, and suddenly became really close friends.

PixelFixers: Another dude I met in a random roblox game, UTPR. Best thing about us is that we both speak Spanish, but didnt know until I accidentally sent an Ñ, then he said "Wait you are spanish? Me too.." and then we discovered we have been talking to each other in English for weeks, and none of us realized the other was Spanish... I owe him a lot for his help on diverse things, even tho he wont stop asking me for hot gay sex in front (and behind) of my gf-

Dream: I first heard of his name in some SS scripts. I immediately became a huge fan of his works, as I love anything related to scripting and that stuff. That was in 2020/2021. Dream and I are now really good friends, and I still remember the days where I basically prayed to god just to meet him...

Kat: Met her thanks to an old friend, played with her and pixel for some days, andddd... Most of you know what happened from there. Me and her friends share a thought about her: That she really likes ghosting, and takes her good 20-30 minutes to answer anything LOL
(Im better than u in most fighting games. Cope with it) 

Asesinazorras2000 (Bltch murderer 2000): Is an irl friend of mine. We share the same personality and like the same things. Only problem is that he does not try to hide anything that might be considered a... *bad side* of his personality (ocassionaly dumps porn in your dms). But hes a really smart and cool dude.

Bek: Hes Darkened's best friend. We are friends even tho I almost doxxed him some months ago because of an argument he had with Dark (Im sorry Bek)

Scythe: Even tho not many call him like that, I like to. If I'm not wrong, hes Xeno's best friend, and a really good friend of mine now ;). Met him after Xeno made a gc with both of us in it, then proceeded to completely disappear from there. We are really close friends nowadays.

WendyAfton: A girl that I met in The Killers (Remember this name) a looong time ago. We talked a bit about... *stuff* and then forgot about each other for months. I saw our old dms some weeks ago and I discovered she was offering herself for some ROBLOX modelling and art (commissions). Her discord is wendy_afton and shes really good at both things. Tell her you come from me if you contact her! (Ill pay you the 30$, Im sorry)
UPADTE: I paid her :3

</Dark Knight>: I first met him after he dmd me from an exploiting server bcs we got along really well. He asked me if I wanted to do some hotel rp with him, and we never did it lol. Currently hes working on a custom Windows skin and a roblox version of windows. Hes a really good C# and lua developer. Respect.
He also helped me mod my bootloader so it looks like a Pip-Boy (I love it)

Nick: Met him after he dmd me over some drama with a guy. We became real good friends. Ill always remember the day he challenged Kat on TSB for a 10$ robux giftcard (he lost)

ALEJANDRO05545: His actual user is Alethmoon but I like calling him ALEJANRO05545. Hes a really close irl friend of mine, and hes the voice of AlOx and The Locutor in The A C C I D E N T (My game series). Hes real good at emotional support, and got a really high level of English.

Satas19: Aside from being a real good friend, hes also my fav cousin. Helped me when my account got beamed (L Ukrainian bozo) and we spend a lot of time together on summer, bcs its the only time I get to be with him. W dude btw.

Marrok: I already mentioned I dont get along with furries, but this guy is something else. Hes incredibly good at listening, and also a really cool dude overall. Been a top TA tester and provided valuable info for optimizing my game. If your pc can withstand TA without melting down, its thanks to this dude. Also met him from The Killers.

Ara: Ara and I used to spend all the day playing SoulShatters together. Around 2022. Shes the one who added me to The Killers, so I owe him A LOT. We suddenly went from 100 to 0, and I dont even know why. She runs a server named EBG 7 Stars-Federation Corporation where shes developing a comic shes drawing 100% alone. Looking forward to becoming as good friends as before. Oh and I forgot how we met lol. I guess it was also playing SS.

Stenys: I met this dude on Fortnite some years ago. If only I knew what was about to come... Hes a SUPER, INCREDIBLY AWESOME NIG- friend. He speaks Spanish, and hes been by my side for all of this time. We both went thru some horrible mental shit and helped each other. I even took control of his channel last summer, and streamed in it. I will always remember those clips.
Te quiero princesita (no homo)

Keybored13: Former soldier of TSSG (The Simple Sandbox Guard. will talk about it later.) We never talked that much, but hes been a great emotional support when my friend almost commited suicide some weeks ago.

WeideyRBM: We met while trolling on an MC server, and recorded the best fucking trolling video ever. Hes also... *extra* patriotic. W dude.

Rui: Thanks to this bro I met FeFe. In other words, thanks to him I busted 30% of my nuts.

Hailo: Im pretty sure hes the best GT chara user in UTPR, and teached me some important stuff. Its been some time since we last talked, yes, but hes still a good friend for me.

Nightmare: TK user. Great tester of TA even tho hes scared of playing the game XDDDD

Uhhoj: TK user. I love his man face pou pfp. This guy is really based and funny. We share a lot of common points in our humor, and we both loved when Dark meowned in vc :3

game.Players.LocalPlayer: Lord, the creator of UTPR. He helped me with recreating his game, the_pitt.mp4, so I could make an ARG for a friend. Thanks for creating that game (and taking more than 600 hours from my life)

Well that does it for the friends section. Now some lore dump.

The Killers is a gc (and server) dedicated to soulshatters. I already forgot what was the primary purpose of it..

SS, or SoulShatters is an Undertale themed fighting game, that got flooded with exploiters and bugs after the dev abandoned it. Thanks to that game, I started scripting. That ended on game developing.

UTPR, or Undertale Test Place Reborn, is a remake of SoulShatters made by Lord (i8cheese) and Lady. Its one of (if not the most) my favorite fighting games. (Nerf Asgore)

TSSG (Formerly known as USSF) is a clan about protecting the servers of a mobile game named Simple Sandbox 2, but often operates in ROBLOX games, too. Im really into Milit RP, and I enjoyed A LOT being part of that server, even tho I cant be that active now. You all will always hold some of my best memories so far. TSSG Stands for The Simple Sandbox Guard.

I got 95% of my LUA experience from exploiting. I used to spend like 5 hours each day scripting customs for SoulShatters, to the point hwere the name of my alt (Casaardiendo) was even getting recognized by people in the game. *I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY, I NEVER USED DESTRUCTIVE EXPLOITS, OR USED THEM JUST TO RUIN PEOPLE'S FUN. I USED SCRIPTS TO MAKE BOSSFIGHTS. BOSSFIGHTS THAT PEOPLE LIKED TO VOLUNTARILY JOIN.*

Ill probably update this as time goes on.
